    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>These snowball cookies are simply irresistible. It's sure to become a go-to during the holiday season, but you'll want to make this snowball cookie recipe all year long. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>⅓ cup powdered sugar, or more as needed</li>
        <li>1 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>½ cup powdered sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup very finely chopped pecans</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place 1/2 cup powdered sugar in a bowl; set aside. </li>
        <li>Beat butter, remaining 1/2 cup powdered sugar, and vanilla with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Gradually mix in flour, pecans, and salt until completely incorporated. Roll dough into walnut-sized balls and place 2 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets. </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until bottoms are light golden brown but tops are still pale, 12 to 15 minutes. (Try not to let cookies get too brown: it's better to undercook them than to overcook them.) </li>
        <li>Remove cookies from the oven and let sit on the baking sheets briefly before removing to wire racks. </li>
        <li>Roll hot cookies in the reserved powdered sugar to coat, then return to the wire racks to cool. Once cooled, roll cookies in the powdered sugar once more. </li>
    </ol>
